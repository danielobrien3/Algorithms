# Algorithms

This repository holds the six (6) projects that made up my **Algorithm Design and Analysis** college class. This class gave me an appreciation for the importance of data structures in software development, and how much of a role they play in creating an algorithm. All of these files were uploaded in one mega-commit because the class did not use github. However, this is still my code. 

## File Naming

I named the files to be easily accessible for potential employers (you?) who want to see proof of my software development skills. The first part of the file name identifies the data structure and algorithm used, and the second part lists the project's number. Both the difficulty of the project and my ability as a software developer increased as the semester progressed. The provided project numbers give context to this progression.
